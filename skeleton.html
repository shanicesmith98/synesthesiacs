			<h1>What is Synthesia?<h1>
				
				<p> <h4> Occurring in less than 4% of the population, synesthesia (pronounced si·nuh·<strong>stee</strong>·zhuh) is a fascinating condition in which the stimulation of one sense activates another sense. Some people with synesthesia can taste an image. Others can feel the texture of a sound. The combinations are seemingly endless! It’s important to remember that synesthesia between senses is only one sided. Someone who can feel the texture of a taste wouldn't be able to taste the texture of an object.

The name, when broken down, is pretty self explanatory: <em>syn</em>, which means "together", and <em>aesthesia</em>, which means "sensation". Someone who has synesthesia is called a synesthete.

There’s one certain combination that is well recurring in synesthetes: the ability to see sound. It’s called chromesthesia, when a sound can conjure up colors in a person’s mind. </h4></p>

				<p> <h4>While an accurate visual representation isn't likely, our team worked together to create a visual representation of sound inspired by chromesthesia. We hope that we can provide a glimpse of it by transforming one beautiful art form into another.</h4></p>
				
				<!-- don't know how to provide the image/video of the sound being converted into visual shapes -->
